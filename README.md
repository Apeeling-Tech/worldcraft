# World Craft Beta #
World craft is a simple game written in Java. At this moment, I am completely rewriting the engine, and eventually will redo the rendering system, using a new pixel based system. The game has many similarities to Minecraft and Terraria.

## Todo List ##
1. Rewrite entire game engine (WIP)
2. Rewrite rendering system to be pixel based (WIP)
3. Finish the world generation (Water, Lava, and Trees)
4. Remake textures, and make them smaller (maybe 16 x 16 blocks)
