# World Craft Beta #
World craft is a simple game written in Java. At this moment, I am completely rewriting the engine. The game has many similarities to Minecraft and Terraria.

## Todo List ##
1. Rewrite entire game engine (WIP)
2. Better input and GUI system
3. Finish the world generation (Water, Lava, and Trees)
4. Remake textures, and make them smaller (maybe 16 x 16 blocks)
